# Integrated AI Voice Control System
 Integrated AI Voice Control System allows players to give commands to AI units within their group using their voice and Windows built-in voice recognition engine, all without having to install any third-party programs.

In the options menu of the main menu there are two new buttons, one to open the testing dialog to test your microphone and Voice Recognition Engine, and another to open the Windows Voice Recognition training program.
